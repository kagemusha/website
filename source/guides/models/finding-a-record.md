You can retrieve a record by passing its model and unique ID to the `find()`
method. This will return a promise that resolves to the requested
record:

```js
store.find('post', 1).then(function(post) {
  post.set('title', "My Dark Twisted Fantasy");
});
```

### Integrating with the Route's Model Hook

As discussed in [Specifying a Route's
Model](/guides/routing/specifying-a-routes-model), routes are
responsible for telling their template which model to render.

`Ember.Route`'s `model` hook supports asynchronous values
out-of-the-box. If you return a promise from the `model` hook, the
router will wait until the promise has resolved to render the
template.

This makes it easy to write apps with asynchronous data using Ember
Data. Just return the requested record from the `model` hook, and let
Ember deal with figuring out whether a network request is needed or not:

```js
App.Router.map(function() {
  this.resource('post', { path: ':post_id' });
});

App.PostRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
  model: function(params) {
    return this.get('store').find('post', params.post_id);
  }
});
```

In fact, this pattern is so common, the above `model` hook is the
default implementation for routes with a dynamic segment. If you're
using Ember Data, you only need to override the `model` hook if you need
to return a model different from the record with the provided ID.
